                                <p>This course is about visual communications. You will have 3 hours in class per week with an additional hour of hybrid/online learning plus some homework time. There is no prior knowledge of a camera or photography needed before taking this class, everything will be taught to you in class. For this class, you will need one of the latest Canon EOS DSLR Camera with at least 1 zoom lens – typically 18-55mm. We will also be using a tripod as well as 5in1 reflectors. Students will be able to borrow some gear from the school if needed.<br> 
                                    The world is less about words and more about pictures in the 21st Century. It will be hard to find work unless you are visually literate. Skills learned in this class will help you greatly in the Video and Motion Graphics courses later in the Program. Storytelling and Visual Literacy will be the foundation of everything you do in your career.

You will have 3 hours in class per week and should do an additional 3 outside of class. This course builds on the work done in Responsive Web Design and Client-side Development. We will look at building out some common use-case like navbars and gallery grids with modern CSS features like Flexbox, Grid and Filters. So, brushing up on the basics of HTML/CSS will help. We will also be doing a little bit of JavaScript. A great reference resource would be the website javascript.info  Equipment needed for this class would be a good laptop and a pencil/paper. <br>
                                    You will get to practice essential skills like estimating work, breaking down requirements into smaller manageable tasks, and effectively collaborating on projects. You will also become more comfortable with standard tools like Git for source code version control and using the command line to install third party libraries.

                                <p>Server-Side Web Development is about using PHP and the MySQL database to build dynamic websites. This means that the website changes based on the user’s request or actions as opposed to static websites that don’t. You don’t have to create each static file, a template can do that from the database. You will have 3 hours in class + 1 hour of independent study and at least the same outside of class. Prior to taking this class students should have a good knowledge of HTML and CSS as well as the programming techniques learned in Client-Side Web Development. Equipment needed for this class would be a computer that meets the minimum requirements for the program. They’ll also need a local development environment (ie Local By Flywheel) and a text editor (VS Code). <br>
                                   PHP is still the most popular server-side language for web development. It is also the language that Wordpress is build on. Wordpress makes up 30% of the web. Knowing how to use a database is crucial for any serious web developer. On top of learning PHP and MySQL , you will gain a greater understanding of what it takes to build real world projects.
